Project is related to room occupancy detection using environmental observations such as temperature, humidity and CO2 level.
Later we implemented LSTM and GRU models with various configurations and hyperparameters to achieve optimal results.
Finally, we compared the accuracy results in a table that includes thirteen different models and represent the confusion matrix for each model to interpret the performance in more detail.
Accuracies are on bottom (If you cannot see the results, you can view it in .ipynb file.) ->
